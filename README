tiny-stuff

tiny tweaks I made when I had nothing to do. Feel free to browse. 
Currently includes:
- Remove Slideshow Button (for iPad):   name says it all.
- NewsstandChanger:                     more like remover; removes Newsstand icon from SpringBoard
- TapdeWiggle:                          tap anywhere outside an icon on edit (wiggle) mode, and you'll be out of it!

Want to host them on your own repo? I'd be glad (and even kinda honored!). Just email me: matoe@matoe.co.cc
